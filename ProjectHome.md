<h3>Abstract</h3>
Due to the rapid development of science and technology. For the body of attitude and position has been used extensive in action Training of Athlete, Movie special effects, Games, Medicine, Rehabilitation, Virtual reality and ergonomics. They have the use of limit whether is a Coach system or games. Such as analysis of sports equipment. they use wire to output.<br>
Researchers and test players always feeling of inconvenience by the wire. Make them feel inconvenience.<br>
So we used Bluetooth 4.0(BLE) to transmission. Implement of Motion Capture. To Analysis and appliance. We used the Gyroscope and the Accelerometer to measurement the angular velocity and acceleration of the body in three-dimensional space. And then we can calculated the attitude of body. In order to enhance the accuracy, we add a Magnetometer to calibration. And the value use the Kalman filter to reduce the error. Then we want to reduce and avoid the Sports injuries by improper posture. And dismiss the wire transmission of the past. Change the incorrect position of athlete. make them have the best of movement efficiency.<br>
Keywords: Low-power wireless transmission, Bluetooth 4.0(BLE), Motion Capture, Kalmen filter, Degrees of Freedom(DOF)
